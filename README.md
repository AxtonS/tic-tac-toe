# tic-tac-toe  

Command line tic tac toe game built with Ruby  
If you don't have ruby installed you can play the game at https://replit.com/@AxtonSmith/tic-tac-toe#README.md  

## plan  

-there should be game state, player, and victory condition check classes  
-game state should save the game state and accept changes from players  
-victory condition should check game state between each player's inputs  
-the display will use a simple pipes and hyphen type grid with X and O's  
-input will be handled with either grid hotkey assignment(qwe,asd, zxc for example), or semantic(tl = top left), both cases should be accepted  

## progress  

-designed a functioning display style for the board  
-built the victory condition check loop and tested functionality for all cases  
-built the input method for players  
-started building the game flow and found working logic to alternate player inputs and display board between rounds  
-Got the game flow to work with victory condition checks and get it fully functional  
-Added in all the display instructions for the game  

## finished  

-learned to implement good object oriented programming principles, tried to never repeat any code  
-learned a lot about ruby style guide by following rubocop which also helped with code readability  
-added a new game option after victory and logic to enter new names for new players

## updates  

-added RSpec testing to learn TDD but will have to refactor this project to get proper test coverage
